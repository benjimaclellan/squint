# `squint`

Welcome to **squint**, a differentiable framework for studying and designing quantum metrology and sensing protocols. This documentation follows the Di√°taxis methodology to provide comprehensive guidance for users at all levels.

Squint enables end-to-end variational quantum sensing (VQS) by providing:

- **Differentiable quantum circuit simulation** for arbitrary qubit, qudit, and Fock systems
- **Integration with JAX** for automatic differentiation and GPU hardware acceleration
